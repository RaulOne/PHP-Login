# PHP-Login
Secure PHP-login with password hashing and protection against html, java and sql injections. 

Based on privileges. 

There is guests zone (guest.php), user zone (user.php) and admin zone(ofc you can have these 3 users within the same page using conditionals).
And if u want an admin just create a new user in you database (you will have to do this manually) with privileges = 2.

Form has php and html validation. Using regular expressions and conditionals. I was about to use javascript also for better and
faster validation but i want to keep it just php+html.

Enjoy
